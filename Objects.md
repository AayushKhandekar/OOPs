# Objects and Classes


## Objects :

- An Object is an entity that has state ( data ) and behavior ( functionality ).

- Objects are created at runtime.

- Objects are an instance of a class. All the data members of a class are accessed through an object.

## Classes :

- Class is a group of similar objects.

- A Class is a template or a blueprint. It can be thought as a concept and an object is the implementation of that concept.

- A class has data members, methods, etc.

- Size of an empty class is NOT zero. It is generally one byte. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-is-the-size-of-an-empty-class-not-zero-in-c/)

- In C++, the default access specifier is 'private'.
