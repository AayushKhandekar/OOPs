# Polymorphism

- 'Poly' means 'many' and 'morphism' means 'forms'. Example : An adult behaves like a father, brother, husband, etc.

- Two types of polymorphism :

    1. Run time Polymorphism
    2. Compile time Polymorphism

- Compile time Polymorphism :

    1. Overloaded functions are invoked by matching the type and number of arguments.
    2. Compiler selects the appropriate function based on above at compile time by function overloading.
    3. It is also known as function overloading, static binding or early binding.
    4. It provides fast execution.

- Run time Polymorphism :

    1. Invoked at run time.
    2. It is also known as overriding, dynamic binding or late binding.
    3. It provides slow execution.
    4. Overriding is a run time polymorphism where more than one method is having the same name, number of parameters and the type of the parameters.
    5. It is achieved by virtual functions and pointers.
