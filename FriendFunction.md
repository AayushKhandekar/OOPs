# Friend Function

- A friend function can access the protected and the private data of a class.

- Keyword - friend

- Function can be defined anywhere in the program.

- Function definition DOES NOT use either the scope resolution operator or the keyword 'friend'.

- Cannot be called using the object as it is not in the scope of the class.

- Can be invoked like a normal function.

- Since it cannot access the data members directly, the object needs to be passed.

- Can be declared either in private or public.
