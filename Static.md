# Static Keyword

- Static belongs to 'type' and not 'instance'.

- In C++, static can be method, field, operator, class, etc.

- Memory is not alloted each time an instance is created. Hence, it is memory efficient.

- Static Field : Only one copy of static field is created which is shared with all objects. It can be used to refer a common property for all objects. Example : Rate of Interest in a bank, Ticket cost per adult, Counting Objects of a class, etc.
