# Abstraction

- Process of hiding essential data (internal details) and showing functionality only. Example : Functionality of an AC, Functionality of an Operating System, etc.

- Can be implemented in two ways :
    1. Using Classes ( Access Specifiers )
    2. Using Header Files ( Math functions in Math.h )
